3. **Create a Feature Branch**
Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
```

4. **Make Your Changes**
Implement your changes, adhering to the existing coding style and practices.

5. **Commit Your Changes**
Make sure your commits follow our commit message conventions for readability and consistency:

Prefix your commit message with one of the following types:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation and examples
- `style:` for formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- `refactor:` for refactoring existing code

7. **Create a Pull Request**
Go to the original repository and create a pull request from your feature branch. Please provide a detailed description of your changes and reference any relevant issues.

## Pull Request Review

Once you submit your pull request, one of the maintainers will review it. We may suggest changes or improvements to ensure quality and consistency with the rest of the exercises.

## After Your Pull Request is Merged

After your pull request is merged, you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

## Additional Guidelines

- Ensure that any new code follows the existing structure and naming conventions.
- Comment your code where necessary to explain complex logic.
- Update the README with details of changes to the interface or new exercise additions.
- Maintain the quality of the exercises and test any changes thoroughly before submitting.
